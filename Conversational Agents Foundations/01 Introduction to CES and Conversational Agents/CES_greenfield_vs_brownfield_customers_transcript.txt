Next, you’ll unpack what greenfield and brownfield implementations look like
with CES. In this module, you’ll learn to: Define greenfield & brownfield
customers. Understand greenfield and brownfield use case examples and their
advantages & disadvantages. And identify a greenfield or brownfield customer.
Let’s get started. Greenfield customers are those who are building their
customer contact center strategy from scratch. They typically have no legacy
systems or infrastructure in place and they are free to choose the best
technology solutions for their needs. Conversely, Brownfield customers are those
who are already operating customer contact centers that have existing systems
and infrastructure in place. They may be looking to upgrade their systems or add
new capabilities, but they need to do so in a way that is compatible with their
existing environment. For both greenfield and brownfield customers, Google CES
can offer a number of benefits. Some example Greenfield use cases are: A startup
company that is building its first chatbot. A consumer goods company that is
expanding into a new market and has no current Conversational Agent
architecture. And a company that is already a Google Cloud customer but wants to
leverage CES tools for internal FAQs. There are many advantages to being a
greenfield customer. To start with, greenfield customers have a clean slate. As
a greenfield customer, you’ll start with a blank canvas with minimal
restrictions from existing systems or processes. This freedom allows for
innovative solutions, and the ability to implement best practices without being
constrained by the past. Additionally, greenfield environments foster agility,
allowing them to move and iterate quickly due to the lack of legacy systems.
This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation to changing requirements. In
some cases, greenfield customers present larger opportunities. Without existing
customer relationships or sales history, there is potential for significant
growth and expansion. However, there are also disadvantages to being a
greenfield customer. Defining the scope of a greenfield project can be a
challenge. Without established parameters, it may be difficult to set clear
goals and measure success. Greenfield customers often face data readiness issues
as there may not be sufficient historical data to support decision-making.
Furthermore, finding skilled resources can be difficult in greenfield
environments. You may need people with specific technical expertise or domain
knowledge that is not yet widely available. Next, let’s analyze the same
information for brownfield customers. Some brownfield example use cases are: A
Fortune 500 company that has an existing Conversational Agent structure already
integrated into legacy systems A consumer goods company that wants to upgrade
its customer Contact Center with new GenAI features and capabilities. And a
large healthcare company that currently has a multi-channel experience outside
of Google Cloud products. Some of the advantages for brownfield customers
include the following. Brownfield customers benefit from existing
infrastructure. You can leverage established systems to implement new features
and capabilities, which saves time and resources compared to building from
scratch. Brownfield environments also offer the opportunity to work with real-
world data. You can experiment and iterate rapidly, using production data to
validate solutions and drive improvements. Typically, brownfield customers have
a deep understanding of their business. This existing knowledge base can be
invaluable in defining requirements and designing solutions that truly meet
their needs. There are also disadvantages with brownfield Customers. Integrating
with legacy systems can be a major challenge. Outdated or incompatible systems
may create complexities and slow down development. In brownfield environments,
you often encounter complex business logic built up over time. This can make it
difficult to understand and modify systems without introducing unintended
consequences. The risk of disruption can be higher when deploying changes in a
brownfield environment. There is a greater likelihood of impacting existing
systems or processes, requiring careful planning and testing. Part of the
challenge when trying to identify greenfield versus brownfield use cases is
related to the fact that conversational experiences never just leverage one
platform or solution like Conversational Agents. Conversational Agents rarely
works alone without calling Apigee or Pub/Sub or other Google Cloud products. As
illustrated in this example diagram, when a user chats with a Conversational
Agents chatbot, there are many systems and tools that interact with the front-
end and back-end systems to create a seamless experience. The “customer-client”,
“chat router”, and “back-end CRM” could be different types of systems, but
ultimately they are connecting the user with the enterprise data and
Conversational Agents to create a conversation. In this example, the chat
application is attached through multiple layers of “UI” engines and platforms,
integrating different cloud solutions. So you must understand all of the
components to the delivery. To summarize, determining whether a client is
considered greenfield or brownfield requires a deep understanding of the client
infrastructure and depends on the use case. Most enterprises will have both
greenfield and brownfield use cases.
