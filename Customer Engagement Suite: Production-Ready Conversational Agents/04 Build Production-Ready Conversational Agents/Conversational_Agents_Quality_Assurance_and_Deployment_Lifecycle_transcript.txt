VIDEO TRANSCRIPT
==================================================

In this module, you’ll analyze the Conversational Agents Quality Assurance and
Deployment Lifecycle, where you will be provided with the tools to assess and
ensure production grade quality of your conversational agent development.
Additionally, you will also review the key tenets of an end to end deployment
lifecycle using the capabilities available in Conversational Agents. The key
focus areas of this module are quality assurance and the deployment lifecycle of
Conversational Agents. Creating a strong testing strategy is fundamental to
delivering high-quality bots. Conversational Agents includes specific features
and tools to help you design and implement tests. Throughout this module, you’ll
discuss those features, and learn how to build your very own test plan. This
includes mapping out test cases and understanding the best way to integrate your
tests into the development process. After your bot has been thoroughly tested,
you’ll dive into the deployment lifecycle. Here, you’ll learn how to move your
bot into upstream environments successfully. Finally, you’ll explore continuous
integration and continuous delivery, also known as CI-CD, which ensures smooth,
error-free automated deployments. Let’s get started.
